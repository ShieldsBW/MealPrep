Meal Prep App first pass notes \- 

Would like to have remaining spoonacular credits visible somewhere. Probably on the home page, recipes page, and plan page. It should show current amount / total available for free usage, and when it resets. 

Probably need to have some way to save user account / profile somewhere, might need to do another firebase server setup? Is there a limit to the free use of that, if i have multiple apps? Or is the limit per app / server? Does my trolley game usage count against the usage for this app?

Would like an estimated price summary on the grocery list page, as well as an estimated cost per meal. I would also like to have the estimates cost per meal shown on the plan page. 

Would like to have an estimate of leftover ingredients, and have the option to optimize for minimal left overs. 

Would like to include ostomy/ileostomy safe meal options when generating meal plan or filtering for recipes, such as no peanuts, pickles, etc. Things that can't get digested properly by people with ostomies. 

Would like to have the ability to save meal plans with a name, and pull them back up on demand from a list, and ideally also be able to edit / modify them and have the shopping list and cost estimates get updated. 

Would like to have a ‘replace’ option for individual recipes on the plan page, to replace an individual recipe with a new idea that still fits the preferences of the plan. 

Would like to have a ‘total prep time’ on the plan page, that adds up the prep time for each recipe.

Don't need the ‘features’ tab on the home page. If we add a user login page, we can put the login / create account buttons on a new landing page and include the title of the app and the features section, as well as a testimonials section below that. Once logged in, it should switch to the current home page / layout we have now. There should be an ‘Account’ and ‘Logout’ button on the top right of the main bar at the top while logged in to the main app.
