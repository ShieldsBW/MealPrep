Meal prep business that uses instacart/uber/grubhub model to let independent chefs prep meals

Goal to break down meal cost / ingredient waste by combining orders to optimize use 

Wouldn't be “on demand”, but queued to achieve 100% usage of as many ingredients as possible 

Customers only pay for the portion of an ingredient their meal needs, plus service cost of the chef (should be balanced to provide good QOL for chef), delivery, and optional tip 

Encourage chefs/meals for unique dietary needs, 

Dairy free  
Vegan  
Vegetarian  
Paleo  
Allergy Safe (nut, shellfish, etc)  
Inflammation, Crohns,  
Thrush/anti fungal,  
Etc.

Basic version should start assuming individuals are going to do the prep / cooking themselves, and be able to link to a user’s instacart account to query their grocery store of choice to check for available ingredients and generate cost estimates of specific meals. The goals should be ease of preparation, and maximizing the amount of easy to freeze / reheat meals that can be generated to meet the user’s criteria as possible. 

Ex. I would like to have a variety of cuisines (chinese, japanese, korean, mexican, american, indian, etc) and a mix of proteins (chicken, beef, pork, etc). With the goal being to avoid similarity day after day, while also minimizing the cost of the ingredients and difficulty of preparation. I would like to be able to freeze and store the meals for a long duration and be able to reheat / prepare them quickly and easily, while also making sure they are all crohns / ileostomy safe.
